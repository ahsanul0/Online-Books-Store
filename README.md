# Online-Books-Store
An online bookstore is a digital platform designed for book lovers and learners alike, offering a wide collection of titles — from fiction and non-fiction to textbooks and reference works — all accessible via the internet. Unlike a traditional physical store, it enables customers to browse, search, and purchase books at any time and from anywhere.
